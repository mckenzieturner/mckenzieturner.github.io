    <p>For my internship I was doing research on different disasters throughout history. I dug deep into each disaster and pulled out the reasons they happened and what kind of safety regulations were in place that may have failed or was ignored. I have only attached 3 of my projects, but I still have many more in the making.</p>
    <p>In my first project I did research about the Deepwater Horizon Blowout. It became the largest oil spill in US history. It wasn't just a disaster that made a huge impact to the wildlife, but it also made an impact on regulations and how the response and cleanup efforts need to be changed. It took a very long time and a lot of money to make a dent in the cleanup efforts. But, there will always be a damaged ecosysytem from that blowout. </p>

    <p> In the second writing project I did it was about the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster. This is one event that most americans know about and some still remember watching it happen. It became a lesson to not ignore the small issues just to achieve a due date. There several people who brought up the concern of the shuttle taking off the next day, but were unfortunately ignored. It created changes that were beneficial to each and every person in those NASA companies.</p>

    <p>In my third project below I wrote about the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. This was a horrible fire that killed many people all because of a poor working condition and safety regulations were not in place. The owner of the factory didn't care about the safety of his employees, only how they performed. It created many safety regulations that are still in place today. There are lots of things to learn from this disaster. </p>
