    <div class="box content"><h1>Hi There!</h1>
        <p>I am studying Environmental Science at Mizzou! I live in Jefferson City, MO but I am originally from St. Louis. This summer I have an internship in Rolla at a company called Brewer Science. At Brewer Science they make semiconductors for different companies all over the world. I am their Safety Intern, and I am loving my job so far. Outside of work and school I love hanging out with my friends and going to the lake on the weekends. My family owns a hobby farm with goats, chickens, and bees! My favorite time of the year is when the babies are born, they are so small! I love watching Cardinals Baseball and Mizzou Football! I canâ€™t wait to be back at the stadium this fall and cheer them on. I am also in Alpha Delta Pi at Mizzou, and I love playing soccer on Stankowski. </p>

          <p>I am receiving an education in Environmental Science at the University of Missouri, Columbia. My major focus is Outreach & Education in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR). I am estimated to graduate college in May 2022. I am pursuing a career in Environmental, Health and Safety and very blessed for every experience I have had that will prepare me for my future. I attended High School in Portland, OR and went to Westside Christian High School for 3 years. I formally grew up in Wentzville, MO prior to moving to Portland. I enjoy hanging out with my friends and going to the lake on the weekends. My family has a dog named Buddy who is a Brittany Spaniel and is so sweet. I am currently working for Brewer Science in Rolla, MO this summer. They are a large company in the semiconductor industry, and I am their Safety Intern. </p>
