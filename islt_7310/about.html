 <h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
 <p> I am studying Environmental Science at Mizzou! I live in Jefferson City, MO but I am originally from St. Louis. This summer I have an internship in Rolla at a company called Brewer Science. At Brewer Science they make semiconductors for different companies all over the world. I am their Safety Intern, and I am loving my job so far. Outside of work and school I love hanging out with my friends and going to the lake on the weekends. My family owns a hobby farm with goats, chickens, and bees! My favorite time of the year is when the babies are born, they are so small! I love watching Cardinals Baseball and Mizzou Football! I canâ€™t wait to be back at the stadium this fall and cheer them on. I am also in Alpha Delta Pi at Mizzou, and I love playing soccer on Stankowski.  </p>
