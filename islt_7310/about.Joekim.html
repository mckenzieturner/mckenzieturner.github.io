     <h1>Joseph Kim</h1>
     <h3><b>Welcome!</b></h3>  
     <p>My name is Joseph Kim, and I am a student in the Information Science and Learning Technologies program at the University of Missouri.</br></br>
         My educational goals seek to develop my competencies in the field of instructional design in higher education. I aspire to collaborate
         with online instructors to develop meaningful and creative online learning experiences for students. This includes helping teachers
         create online class activities, projects, quizzes, and homework. Additionally, I seek to utilize my graphic design, video editing, and 
         Adobe Captivate skills to enhance the multimedia aspect of online classes.</p>

        <p>“Education at its best – this profound human transaction called teaching and learning – is not just about getting information or getting a job. Education is about healing and wholeness. It is about empowerment, liberation, transcendence, about renewing the vitality of life. It is about finding and claiming ourselves and our place in the world.”</p>
        <p><em>Parker Palmer,</em> cited by Bell Hooks in Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope</p>
