 <h1> Reflection </h1> 

 <p> A few things that I learned in my current internship are as follows. I have had great experience working in a semiconductor company and excited to see where it takes me.  </p>
<br/>
<p>     Volatile organic compounds monitoring is a simple monitoring system that is used for air monitoring. I think that it is beneficial for every company because it goes along with the rules and regulations. It keeps the workers safe from inhaling any type of gas or particles that could be dangerous. </p>
<br/>
<p>     Respirator fit tests are the next informational project. I am learning about these to keep workers safe in their business. I learned how to properly fit an employee based on the type of respirator and the fit on their face. Each respirator has a different purpose, and some keep you safer than others. There are multiple different types of respirators so finding the right one for the employee is the important part because you donâ€™t want any dangerous fumes of particles getting in. I think learning about respirators is one of my favorite parts about my internship because you get to really know each coworker and what they do during their job. </p>
<br/>
<p>     Emergency showers and eye wash stations are very important to any business and especially at this company. We encounter a lot of chemicals each day and there are a lot of different experiments happening. You always want to be prepared for any type of emergency and make sure that each employee is properly trained. You want everyone to be safe and understand how they respond to an emergency. </p>
<br/>
<p>     So far, my career has been a great experience and I am excited to see where it can lead. There are a lot of things that I have learned but also so much I want to learn. I am always looking for different ways to broaden my experience. I think that my career path will lead me to learning a lot about different industries and how they operate. I think that I have a great path set up because of the opportunities I have and the experience under my belt. My current internship is a great start when it comes to finding a career path that I will enjoy and continue to learn from. Mizzou has prepared me for many different things to come in my future and I am excited to see where it takes me. My dad always knew I would end up in a career that would lead me to some type of manufacturing company. </p>
